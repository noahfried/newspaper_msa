		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The United States Newspaper Panel, 1869-2004 contains data on US daily newspapers from 1869 and every presidential year from 1872 to 2004. The data includes information on newspaper political affiliation, party endorsement, circulation, subscription price, advertising price, content, publications times, and publisher. The data came from George P. Rowell and Company's (Rowell's) American Newspaper Directory (1869-1876), N.W. Ayer and Son's (Ayer's) American Newspaper Annual (1880-1928), and the Editor and Publisher Yearbook (1932-2004).</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> 2007-01 -- 2010-11</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> Due to the lack of information, this collection has been minimally processed by ICPSR., Please refer to the related data collection ICPSR 35513, US Newspapers in the American South, 1869-1896, for data supplementary to this collection.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> This collection includes English-language daily newspapers. A newspaper is considered to be a daily if it circulates 4 or more weekdays each week. In cases where newspapers published multiple editions, typically both a morning and evening edition, those were treated as separate records.
Foreign-language newspapers, national newspapers (the Christian Science Monitor, Wall Street Journal and USA Today), and some non-news publications (e.g., real estate listings, live stock listings, etc.) were excluded from the sample. Please see the User Guide for additional information.</span></p>
